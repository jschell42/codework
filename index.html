<p>In this Institute for Advanced Studies Research and Creative Collaborative, we will examine the possibility of establishing a Digital Studies minor or certificate at the University of Minnesota through the specific discursive, material, and historical character of code. Looking at such a fundamental element of the world we live in today, an element that forms, in Jussi Parikka’s words, the "algorithmic unconscious" of so much daily life, it is necessary to adopt a variety of lenses drawn from across the spectrum of knowledge production. Instead of focusing on disciplines, however, we will focus on themes such as writing, language, law, history, labor, and identity as they relate to code and coding. We envision our collaborative as a space for interdisciplinary engagement and collaboration, and hope to attain this by modeling a different type of interaction and communication, away from reading groups and panel discussions and more towards a lab environment, one focused on exploration of ideas as well as putting those ideas into practice, through code. In doing so, we hope to explore both the content of a Digital Studies program, as well as a possible pedagogical model for that program.</p>
